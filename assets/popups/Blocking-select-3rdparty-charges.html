		<h3>Cramming is the assessment of unauthorized charges on your telephone bill. To help prevent cramming contact CenturyLink and request, at no charge, a bill block that will prevent non-telecommunication charges, such as charitable contributions and non-CenturyLink dial-up Internet charges, from appearing on your bill.</h3>
		<h3>If you request this bill block you will still enjoy the convenience of receiving charges for your traditional telecommunications-related services such as long distance, operator assisted services, collect calls and directory assistance on your CenturyLink bill. </h3>
		<h3>CenturyLink suggests the following pointers that will assist you in helping prevent these charges from appearing on your bill, and includes information on how you can get help if you experience cramming, or you see unwanted or other unauthorized charges on your bill.<br><br>
		<li>You can have third party charges blocked by contacting the CenturyLink customer service number on your bill.  There is no charge for this service.</li><br>
		<li>You can call CenturyLink to report an unauthorized third party charge that appeared on your telephone bill, and CenturyLink will remove the charges from your bill.</li><br>
		<li>Third party charges are found on the first page summary under `third party providers’.  They will be broken out in detail on the last pages of the bill.</li>
