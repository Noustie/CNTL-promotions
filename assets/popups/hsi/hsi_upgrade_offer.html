			<span class="bold">*Limited Time Offer.</span>

			Offer available to existing, eligible, residential CenturyLink&reg; High-Speed Internet ("HSI") customers only.  Existing customers may lose current discounts by subscribing to this offer.  If customer increases current HSI speed to an eligible higher speed tier, customer can receive a $5 discount per month off the standard monthly rate for the higher speed selected for 6 consecutive months.

			<span class="bold">At the end of six months, the then-current standard monthly rate for the speed selected will apply.  Changes to customer’s HSI service initiated by customer during the promotional period may void offer discount. Offer not available on certain other discounted service plans; contact CenturyLink for details.  Limit one upgrade offer per household.  Customer may receive only one $5 monthly discount, regardless of number of speed tiers upgraded to.  </span>

			If modem upgrade is required or requested, a shipping and handling fee will apply to new modem and an increase in modem monthly recurring fee may apply. Offer subject to speed availability in customer’s location.

			<span class="bold">Offer cannot be combined with any other discounts or promotions and excludes taxes, fees and surcharges.  Customer must remain in good standing to receive offer.  Additional restrictions will apply.  </span>
