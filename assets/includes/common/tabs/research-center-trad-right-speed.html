	<h3>Find the Internet speed that's right for you</h3>
	<p>Everyone uses the Internet in their own way. Maybe you just use it primarily for email and basic Web browsing. Maybe you Skype with family and upload a lot of photos. The faster the Internet speed, the more you have to pay. So make sure you pay for only what you need.</p>

	<p>It's important to answer a few questions to determine what Internet speed level is right for you:</p>

	<p class="tab-heading">How many devices will be sharing your Internet connection?</p>
	<p>Computers, tablets, gaming systems, even your TV can all use a lot of your connection speed. If numerous devices are used in your home regularly, you are a candidate for a higher speed.</p>

	<p class="tab-heading">How many people in your home are using the Internet connection at a given moment?</p>
	<p>The higher the number, the less speed each person experiences. You may want to increase your speed level.</p>

	<p class="tab-heading">Do you download music, upload lots of photos or regularly watch streaming videos on Netflix, YouTube or Hulu?</p>

	<p>These activities consume a good amount of your total bandwidth. A higher speed level may be appropriate for you.
