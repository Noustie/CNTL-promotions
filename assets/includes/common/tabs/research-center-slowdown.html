	<p class="tab-heading">About Internet speed</p>
	<p>Here's a truth that some Internet providers don't like to talk about: You don't always get the maximum advertised speed you signed up for, not all the time. But you already know that. There are times when your Internet connection seems to inexplicably slow down and then speed back up, regardless of the provider. We work hard to deliver consistently high speeds from the CenturyLink network and want to work with you to ensure you get the best service possible. Here are the technical details you need to make an informed choice:</p>
	 
	<p class="tab-heading">Bandwidth</p>
	<p>Generally, CenturyLink customers can expect a connection speed ranging from 85% to 100% of the highest threshold that was purchased (look for the phrase: "speeds up to X Mbps").  The percentage varies due to a number of factors, including: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>The quality of the wiring inside your home</li>
		<li>The response times of websites you're visiting</li>
		<li>Amount of customer usage of the network during peak periods of the day </li>
		<li>The condition of your computer and network equipment within your home</li>
		<li>The location of your home relative to our network's backbone</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="tab-heading">Latency</p>
	<p>"Latency" is a term that refers to the amount of delay experienced on a network and it varies, depending on the path taken through the network, other providers in the path who relay the signal, as well as the actual distance to the destination, and performance of the end destinations' servers.  If you have an online gamer in the house, then latency is definitely something to consider. CenturyLink&reg; High-Speed Internet customers typically experience round-trip latency (the amount of delay for information to travel from the user's computer to a general Internet site and back) in the range of 50-150 milliseconds.  </p>

	<p class="tab-heading">Can you install CenturyLink&reg; High-Speed Internet service yourself?</p>
	<p>The short answer is: you probably shouldn't. But the long answer is: Splitters/home run jacks are used to separate the phone and High-Speed Internet signal on the line. One jack inside the customer's home is dedicated to Internet, and the remaining jacks have Voice service only. Technicians set up special wiring to ensure the jack serving the computer is wired directly to the phone box. A phone jack near the computer is required in order to connect the modem to the CenturyLink network. If you do not have a phone jack near the computer, then save yourself frustration and order the Tech Install. A CenturyLink Tech Install may be necessary if:</p>
	<ul> 
		<li>Your previous provider was a cable company, as we'll need to reconnect the CenturyLink phone box to your inside wiring.</li>
		<li>If your home was built before 1980, since an older home's wiring doesn't support maximum High-Speed Internet speeds.</li>
		<li>If you live in an apartment building.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you do require Tech Install, rest assured. CenturyLink field technicians regularly score 9 out of 10 for the majority of attributes tracked by Net Promoter Score surveys. </p>
