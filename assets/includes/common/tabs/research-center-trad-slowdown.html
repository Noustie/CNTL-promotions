	<p class="tab-heading">What causes the Internet to slow down?</p>
	<p>Here's the secret that Internet providers don't want you to know: You're not always going to get the maximum advertised speed you signed up for. The fact is that no company can promise you 100% of your speed level 100% of the time. </p>

	<p>Compare the Internet to your home's water supply. If you're the only person home and you take a shower, you get good water pressure. But if someone else is in the kitchen running the faucet, your shower gets a little weaker, and even more so if the washing machine is also running. This type of effect also applies to the Internet.</p>

	<p>CenturyLink customers can generally expect actual delivered speed ranging from 85% to 100% of the speed purchased (that's above average for the industry).  The fact is, the Internet speed you actually experience is always changing, often due to factors outside of our control, like the condition of your computer and network equipment and the quality of the wiring within your home.</p>
	 
	<p class="tab-heading">Tips for getting the most out of our Internet speed</p>
	<p>There are a few things you can do on your own to make sure you're getting the highest speed possible for your Internet connection:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Install or run the latest virus protection software today.</li>
		<li>Eliminating unnecessary software and files, since the amount of available memory on your computer can affect the speeds you are receiving.  </li>
		<li>If you use a wireless signal, make sure it's secure. If others are using your signal, it can slow down your Internet speeds</li>
		<li>Make sure your modem is compatible with your technology.  </li>
