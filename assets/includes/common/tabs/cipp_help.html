	<h2>Here is some helpful information if you've been notified of infection:</h2>

	<p class="green bold">I keep getting a notification that there’s a virus on my network. What does "my session has been limited" mean?</p>

	<p>CenturyLink limits access to the Internet for customers to make you aware that the computer or a computer associated with this account is infected with a virus or malware. CenturyLink needs you to clean the virus or malware from the infected computer to prevent you from infecting other users on the Internet.</p>

	<p class="green bold">I'm certain the computer I'm on doesn't have a virus.</p>

	<p>There are possibly other computers associated with this account. For example, other computers connected to the network could be infected. It is also possible that you have cleaned the infected computer between the time a virus was detected on your account and when CenturyLink limited your Internet session. If this is the case, follow the instructions on the notification and acknowledge that you have removed the virus.</p>

	<p>If your network supports wireless access and wireless security is not turned on, then it is possible for others to use your network without your knowledge. Make sure your wireless network has security enabled.</p>

	<p class="green bold">I don't know how to clean a virus from my computer. Can CenturyLink clean my computer for me?</p>
