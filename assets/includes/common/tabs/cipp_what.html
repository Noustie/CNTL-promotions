	<p>The Consumer Internet Protection Program (CIPP) is part of CenturyLink's ongoing commitment to make the Internet safer for customers and is available to most residential and small-business CenturyLink high-speed internet customers at no additional charge.  It's yet another way that CenturyLink is Stronger Connected. </p>

	<p>CIPP provides virus and malware notification, mitigation and security education.</p>

	<p><span class="bold">CenturyLink does not monitor our customers' Internet traffic,</span> but relies on trusted third party notification that our customers’ computers are performing malicious acts on the Internet, such as trying to scan and infect other computers on the Internet, sending spam from their computers, participating in botnets that launch denial of service attacks against other Internet users or websites and other malicious activity. </p>

	<p>We understand that you are not performing these actions, but that your computer is infected with malicious software and someone else or the malware is performing those actions.</p>


	<h3>What is a Computer Virus?</h3>
	<p>A virus is a hidden program that spreads itself to other computers, usually without your knowledge.
		<ul>
			<li>Viruses often spread through e-mail attachments or files downloaded from the Internet</li>
			<li>Some viruses do their damage as soon as they infect a computer, but others may lie dormant</li>
			<li>Although some viruses are harmless, many can be quite harmful, slowing your computer's performance and/or permanently destroying your important files </li>
			<li>Viruses can allow others to take control of your computer and steal your personal information</li>
		</ul>
