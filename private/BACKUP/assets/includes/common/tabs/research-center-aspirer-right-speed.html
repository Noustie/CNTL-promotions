	<h3>The smart choice for clever people</h3>
	<p>Some people pay a premium for 40 Mbps High-Speed Internet and use every bit of it. Others pay for 60 Mbps but honestly would be just as happy with their speed at 7 Mbps. Actually, they'd be a lot happier with 7 Mbps because they'd be paying a lot less. The point is, you shouldn't pay for speed that you don't use. Sometimes people buy a faster speeds just in case they change the way they use the Internet and need it in the future. Why not be realistic and pay for the speed that's right for the way you currently use the Internet? You can always increase your speed level in the future if needed, and you'll spend less money between now and then.</p>
	 
	<p class="tab-heading">What do you do online? </p>
	<p>Everyone uses the Internet in their own way. Whatever you do online, we want your Internet service to fit.  Consider this as you decide what Internet speed level is right for you.

	<p class="tab-heading">How many devices will be sharing your Internet connection?</p>
	<p>Your laptops, tablets, PlayStations, Xboxes, Kindles, your flat screen, even your smartphone – if used simultaneously, all of them can drain speed from your connection. If you have a bunch of devices, you're a candidate for a higher speed.</p>

	<p class="tab-heading">How many people are using the Internet where you live?</p>
	<p>The more people using bandwidth on any device, the slower the connection for everyone. If you share space with people who spend a lot of time on the Internet, you may want to increase your speed level. If it's just you, then you can opt for a lower speed without sacrificing the experience, and save money.</p>

	<p class="tab-heading">Do you or other members of your household download a lot of music, participate in online gaming or regularly watch streaming videos on Netflix, YouTube or Hulu?</p>
	<p>Streaming and file sharing consume serious bandwidth. A higher speed level may be in the cards for you.</p>

	<p class="tab-heading">Do you game?</p>
	<p>Popular online games like World of Warcraft and Guild Wars, and Wi-Fi enabled platforms like Xbox and PlayStation 3 all demand a strong network connection to provide the real-time play that make those games and systems so much fun. Even more than speed, you'll hear people talk about the importance of low "latency" when gaming online. CenturyLink&reg; High-Speed Internet customers typically experience round-trip latency in the range of 50-150 milliseconds. </p>
