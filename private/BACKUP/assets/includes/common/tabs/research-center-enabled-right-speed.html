	<h3>Find your happy place</h3>

	<p>We want our customers to be happy, and we know you want us to be candid with you. We will. The chart below shows the speeds we offer as well as the speeds required for common Internet activities. We’re not going to try to sell you something you don’t need, but we do want to make sure you can do what you want to do online.</p>

	<p>It’s important to answer a few questions to determine what Internet speed level is right for you:</p>

	<p class="tab-heading">How many devices will be sharing your Internet connection?</p>
	<p>Computers, tablets, gaming systems, even your TV can all use a lot of your connection speed. If numerous devices are used in your home regularly, you are a candidate for a higher speed.</p>

	<p class="tab-heading">How many people in your home are using the Internet connection at a given moment?</p>
	<p>The higher the number, the less speed each person experiences. You may want to increase your speed level.</p>

	<p class="tab-heading">Do you or other members of your household download a lot of music, participate in online gaming or regularly watch streaming videos on Netflix, YouTube or Hulu?</p>
	<p>These activities consume some serious bandwidth. If you expect to be streaming video in the bedroom while other family members are streaming music or television in the living room, then our higher speeds are probably ideal for you.</p>
