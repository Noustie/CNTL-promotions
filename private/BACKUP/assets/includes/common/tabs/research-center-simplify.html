	<p class="tab-heading">Make life simpler by bundling your services on one bill.</p>
	<p>Build the bundle that's right for you by selecting only the services you want. <a href="/home/bundles/">Bundling with CenturyLink</a> gives you all your communications and entertainment services on one bill – for less. For example, if you bundle TV, High-Speed Internet and Home Phone through CenturyLink, you'll get those service for less than if you were to order them individually. And, if you live in certain areas, you can add Verizon Wireless service through CenturyLink to your bundle, and you save even more.<p>
	<p>Many customers save by bundling CenturyLink services. You can bundle:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="/home/internet/">High&ndash;Speed Internet</a></li>
		<li><a href="/home/phone/">Home Phone</a></li>
		<li><a href="/home/mobile/">Verizon Wireless service through CenturyLink</a></li>
		<li><a href="/home/tv/">DIRECTV&reg; service (not available in all areas)</a>, and/or</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.seeprismtv.com">Prism&trade; TV</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p class="tab-heading">Price-Lock Guarantee</p>
	<p>CenturyLink customers have access to something no other provider offers: the <a href="http://promotions.centurylink.com/offers/5years/">CenturyLink Price-Lock Guarantee</a>. That means the monthly price you sign up for will be the same &ndash; no surprises. And there's no term commitment, so the price is locked in, but you're not. </p>
