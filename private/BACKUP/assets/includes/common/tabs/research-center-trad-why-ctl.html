	<p class="tab-heading">Let's start with TV that's simply the best.</p>
	<p>CenturyLink offers two different types of TV services – <a href="/home/tv/">DirecTV&reg;</a> and <a href="http://www.seeprismtv.com/">Prism&trade; TV</a> – depending on where you live. Both provide access to all your local channels, as well as hundreds of your favorite channels and thrilling On Demand programming. If you can't decide between your favorite sitcom and the big game, you can choose both. With one of our DVRs, you can record as many as 4 different shows at the same time. The best part is how user-friendly our TV services are. From the remote control to the program guide, your TV will be simple to use.</p>

	<p class="tab-heading">Customer service is our top priority.</p>
	<p>As a CenturyLink customer, you'll never feel neglected. There's a reason our field technicians regularly score very high – as in 9 out of 10 – on the Net Consumer Survey Scores: we consider taking care of you our most important job. So that's what we do. Our technical support team is available 24/7 in case you 
	have questions or concerns. </p>

	<p class="tab-heading">Get a price you can count on with the Price-Lock Guarantee.</p>
	<p>CenturyLink customers have access to something no other provider offers – the <a href="http://promotions.centurylink.com/offers/5years/">CenturyLink Price-Lock Guarantee</a>. That means the monthly price you sign up for will be the same – no surprises. And there's no term commitment, meaning the price is locked in, but the customer isn't – you can stop your services at any time if you need to, with no penalty.</p>

	<p class="tab-heading">Bundle for savings and simplicity.</p>
	<p><a href="/home/bundles/">Bundling CenturyLink services</a> is a popular way to save money. You can bundle: </p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="/home/internet/">High-Speed Internet</a></li>
		<li><a href="/home/phone/">Home Phone</a></li>
		<li><a href="/home/tv">DIRECTV&reg;</a>/<a href="http://www.seeprismtv.com/">Prism&trade; TV</a></li>
		<li><a href="/home/mobile/">Verizon Wireless service through CenturyLink</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Mix and match the services you need to build the bundle that's right for you. You can get all your communications and entertainment services on one bill – for less. For example, customers who bundle TV, Internet and Phone with CenturyLink get a lower bill every month than if they were to order the same services ordered individually. And you can save even more adding Verizon Wireless service through CenturyLink to your bundle. It just makes sense.</p>
