	<p class="tab-heading">About Internet speed</p> 
	<p>Here's a truth that some Internet providers don't like to talk about: You don't always get the maximum advertised speed you signed up for, not all the time. But you already know that. There are times when your Internet connection seems to inexplicably slow down and then speed back up, regardless of the provider. We work hard to deliver consistently high speeds from the CenturyLink network, and want to work with you to ensure you get the best service possible. Here are the technical details you need to make an informed choice:</p>
	 
	<p class="tab-heading">Bandwidth</p> 
	<p>Generally, CenturyLink customers can expect a connection speed ranging from 85% to 100% of the highest threshold that was purchased (look for the phrase: "speeds up to X Mbps"). The percentage varies due to a number of factors, including: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>The quality of the wiring inside your home</li> 
		<li>The response times of websites you're visiting</li>
		<li>Amount of customer usage of the network during peak periods of the day </li>
		<li>The condition of your computer and network equipment within your home</li>
		<li>The location of your home relative to our network's backbone</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="tab-heading">Latency</p>
	<p>"Latency" is a term that refers to the amount of delay experienced on a network and it varies, depending on the path taken through the network, other providers in the path who relay the signal, as well as the actual distance to the destination, and performance of the end destinations' servers. If you have an online gamer in the house, then latency is definitely something to consider. CenturyLink® High-Speed Internet customers typically experience round-trip latency (the amount of delay for information to travel from the user's computer to a general Internet site and back) in the range of 50-150 milliseconds.  </p>

	<p class="tab-heading">The quality of your equipment matters.
	<p>Only <a href="/home/internet/#see_features">CenturyLink supplied equipment</a> is guaranteed to work on our network and is supported by CenturyLink technical support. Non-CenturyLink supplied equipment won't give you the optimal speed that you'll get with CenturyLink equipment. </p>

	<p>Our Advanced Wireless Networking Modem gives you:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Fast data speeds in virtually any room in your home.</li>
		<li>Built-in, wireless router lets you share high-speed Internet access, files and printers among five computers at the same time. </li>
		<li>Always-on wireless security.</li>
		<li>Windows and Mac compatible.	</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="tab-heading">Maximize your speed.</p>
	<p>Whether you end up getting your Internet service from CenturyLink or from one of our competitors, here's a refresher on what you can do on your own to make sure you're getting the highest speed possible for your Internet connection:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Install or run the latest virus protection software today.</li>
		<li>Eliminating unnecessary software and files, since the amount of available memory on your computer can affect the speeds you are receiving.</li>
		<li>If you use a wireless signal, make sure it's secure. If others are using your signal, it can slow down your Internet speeds.</li>
		<li>Make sure your modem is compatible with your technology.</li>
	</ul>
