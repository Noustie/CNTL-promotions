	<h1>Frequently asked questions.</h1>
	<p>Below are some areas where customers often have questions.</p>
</div>

<div id="main" class="container faqs">
	<h2>I want to take advantage of savvisdirect features. Do I have to host my website with CenturyLink to do so?</h2>
	<p>Yes, to take advantage of the many CenturyLink features your domain must be hosted through us. Our team of specialists will consult with you on choosing an appropriate domain name and how to get the most out of your CenturyLink Business Bundle!</p>

	<h2>I currently have a website hosted elsewhere. What are my options.</h2>
	<p>Even if you currently have a website elsewhere, CenturyLink can assist in transferring services. Web services with CenturyLink will save your business on web-hosting and domain registration fees while delivering multiple add-ons to maximize the efficiency of your website. </p>

	<h2>I am ready to activate my products in my CenturyLink Business Bundle. What do I need for my phone appointment?</h2>
	<p>If you are ready for your phone consultation we recommend that you have access to a computer for activating products available during the call. If you currently have a website and are interested in transferring hosting to CenturyLink please have your current hosts’ (i.e., GoDaddy, Netfirms, 1&amp;1) login information ready during the call. That is all you need to activate your CenturyLink Business features. Then a Technology Support Team member will call you during your scheduled appointment time to activate your features. </p>

	<h2>When activating products through CenturyLink, will I have to spend time activating and managing them?</h2>
	<p>CenturyLink offers a product consultation in which a specialist will identify your business needs, and then proceed to help you get the most out of your package. This will require setup by you, as well as periodic management of your business email accounts and website. However a team of specialists is available for a fee to handle all of your business features.</p>

	<h2>I currently have emails through a different provider. What can CenturyLink do for me?</h2>
	<p>Up to 500 email accounts are included with your CenturyLink Business Bundle. These email accounts provide you with the means to professionally communicate with your customers. Our email system is scalable, allowing you to add email accounts as your business continues to grow. A specialist will assist you in activating and configuring email accounts for your communication needs. </p>

	<h2>I already have a Fax machine. Why should I use Cloud Fax?</h2>
	<p>Fax machines are a thing of the past!  With CenturyLink’s Cloud Fax option you can send and receive fax messages digitally without ever using a piece of paper. Our Cloud Fax feature allows your small business to take a leap into the future as well as reduce the business’ impact on the environment. Our specialists can help you identify if Cloud Fax is a solution for your small business. </p>
