Scientists have also begun to examine how\nmeditation may influence brain functions. This talk will examine the\neffect of mindfulness meditation practice on the brain systems in which\npsychological functions such as attention, emotional reactivity, emotion\nregulation, and self-view are instantiated. We will also discuss how\ndifferent forms of meditation practices are being studied using\nneuroscientific technologies and are being integrated into clinical\npractice to address symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress.\n\nSpeaker: Philippe Goldin\nPhilippe is a research\nscientist and heads the Clinically Applied Affective Neuroscience group in\nthe Department of Psychology at Stanford University. \n\nHe spent 6 years in India and Nepal studying various languages,\nBuddhist philosophy and debate at Namgyal Monastery and the Dialectic\nMonastic Institute, and serving as an interpreter for various Tibetan\nBuddhist lamas. He then returned to the U.S. to complete a Ph.D. in\nClinical Psychology at Rutgers University. His NIH-funded\nclinical research focuses on (a) functional neuroimaging investigations of cognitive-affective mechanisms in adults with anxiety disorders, (b)\ncomparing the effects of mindfulness meditation and cognitive-behavioral\ntherapy on brain-behavior correlates of emotional reactivity and regulation, and (c) training children in family and elementary school settings in mindfulness skills to reduce anxiety and enhance compassion, self-esteem and quality of family interactions."},"8XCWP4pODbs":{"id":"8XCWP4pODbs","watch":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8XCWP4pODbs&feature=youtube_gdata_player","description":"Google Tech Talk\nJanuary 28, 2010\n\nABSTRACT\n\nPresented by Shinzen Young.\n\nThe purpose of this talk is threefold: (1) to describe how senior adepts use mindfulness to reduce suffering and gain insight into selfhood and emotions. (2) To point out how the method they use in many ways parallels what scientists do when confronted with a complex and inscrutable system in nature. (3) To discuss how this fundamental parallelism between the two endeavors can become the basis for a productive collaboration in the future.\n\nBio: Shinzen Young became fascinated with Asian culture while a teenager in Los Angeles. Later he enrolled in the Ph.D. program in Buddhist Studies at the University of Wisconsin. Eventually, he went to Asia and did extensive training in each of the three major Buddhist meditative traditions: Vajrayana, Zen, and Vipassana. Upon returning to the United States, his intellectual interests shifted to the burgeoning dialogue between Eastern internal science and Western technological science. In recognition of his\noriginal contributions to that dialogue, the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology has awarded him an honorary doctorate. Shinzen's innovative techniques for pain management derived from two sources: The first is his personal experience dealing with discomfort during intense periods of meditation in Asia, and during shamanic ceremonies with tribal cultures. The second is some three decades of experience in coaching people through a wide spectrum of chronic and acute pain challenges. Shinzen leads meditation retreats in the mindfulness tradition throughout North America, and has helped establish several centers and programs."},"peA6vy0D5Bg":{"id":"peA6vy0D5Bg","watch":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=peA6vy0D5Bg&feature=youtube_gdata_player","description":"Google Tech Talks\nMarch 15, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIf happiness is an inner state, influenced by external conditions but not dependent on them, how can we achieve it?

Davidson\n\nIn this talk, Richard J. Davidson will explore recent scientific research on the neuroscience of positive human qualities and how they can be cultivated through contemplative practice. Distinctions among different forms of contemplative practices will be introduced and they will be shown to have different neural and behavioral consequences, as well as important consequences for physical health in both long-term and novice practitioners. New research also shows that meditation-based interventions delivered online can produce behavioral and neural changes. Collectively, this body of research indicates that we can cultivate adaptive neural changes and strengthen positive human qualities through systematic mental practice."},"tRRXRlddibg":{"id":"tRRXRlddibg","watch":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tRRXRlddibg&feature=youtube_gdata_player","description":"Google Tech Talk\nDecember 9, 2009\n\nABSTRACT\n\nPresented by Dacher Keltner.
