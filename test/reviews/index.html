Fortunately for ISP's they all are lagging behind the times so no one knows any better than to accept the services. Payment models are from the 20th century the speeds (particularly upload) assume it's not being leveraged when they are more important now than ever and more and more people consume data over the internet like never before with smart devices such as phone, TV, and touch devices. In a world where companies like Microsoft are writing operating systems for smart homes and not to mention the classic desktop/server machines where everyone is using blogging and home brewed websites for hobby projects and contacts. Any ISP in modern times only have outpaced services and aren't knowledgeable on how to properly monetize their customers' use of the internet services they provide.

                <span class="description">Great system, but still getting digital dropout on some channels. I thought this was just growing pains for Prism, but it is not getting any better. I know one Prism customer that wants to cancel because Prism cannot fix their picture freezing and dropouts. My main DVR box re-boots now and then and/or completely freezes up and I have to re-boot it. Sometimes the DVR stops recording for no apparent reason. The limit of two HD recordings at a time is absurd! If I want to record three or more shows, I must record them in non-HD mode! What a waste of a HD TV set! There should be no limit to recording shows or watching on TV on a set-top box. I have five boxes (TVs) and can only use four at a time unless two of them are watching the same program.

It finally seems like these issues have finally been fixed. I wish that when I want to record a show that has already started, that it would record from the start of the show. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. It's upsetting with some shows that if you miss the first few minutes, you lose the gist of the entire show. I wish there was more grouping of like shows, ie: putting all &quot;shopping&quot; shows together. Perhaps make it a 'cafeteria' style plan where one doesn't have to pay for shows they never watch. Overall, I am pleased with my Prism.

Everyone out here would be VERY happy to pay the cost for faster internet and some have turned from Centurylink because the connection is SO SLOW. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, consider trying to get a faster speed to our area. Even just the next one up would be a HUGE improvement.

                <span class="description">When I signed up for the service I was excited about the promised speeds. But when the installer came he found that my neighborhood in Murray, UT simply was too far away from the signal source to get high enough speed. He couldn't even get me to 1 Mbps. He tried very hard to make it work, but was honest with me that I wasn't going to be able to get the promised speed. I work from home and download a lot of documents, so I appreciated his efforts and his honesty. I was just disappointed that you were unable to deliver. I had to go back to my cable provider to get Internet. Even more frustrating, my monthly bill included a large bill from you for the Internet service I never got. I'm assuming on next month's bill I will get a credit, but the whole experience has been frustrating and disappointing, with the exception of your very good installer. He was first rate, was honest and tried very hard to ensure not only would I have good phone service, but good DSL. His customer service alone helped keep me as a telephone customer.
