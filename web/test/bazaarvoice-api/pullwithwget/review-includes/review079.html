				<p>I got Prism TV in January 2013. Every since I had prism it have been freezing so much that sometimes I can't even watch a movie completely through. I am thinking about going to another service provider. The customer service is great. The people are nice and easy to talk too. But they can only do so much. This could be a great product. Until they work out all of the bug it is garbage.</p>
