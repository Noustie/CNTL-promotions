				<p>I wish I had the ability to create folders for my recordings so that I could find them faster. We record a lot of shows for my daughter and keep them b/c she likes to watch the episodes multiple times. However, I hate having to scroll through all of them to get to my recordings. If I had a kids folder that I could put them in, then I could find my shows faster. I also wish I had the ability to recover deleted recordings. I've accidentally deleted one before and wanted it back, but there was no recovering it.<br />
<br />
As for the glitches, I still see freezing from time to time. Maybe once every other month. Not enough to complain or call about. Also, the video can sometimes get distorted on fast action sports like football or NASCAR racing during shots with a lot of movement.<br />
