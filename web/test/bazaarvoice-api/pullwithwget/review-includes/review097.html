				<p>We are pleased with PRISM...but if you are a sports fan, this is NOT the program for you. Very disappointed that there is very limited MLB baseball on PRISM. Had I known this in the beginning, I might not have switched. But we do get alot more channels than we had before. Just wish that Major League Baseball would be added to the channel line up.</p>
