				<p>We many problems with Prism since our installation 2 years ago, mainly with picture freezing, cable going down with no use of my computer for anywhere from 2 - 20 minutes, 1-2 times a day. It finally seems like these issues have finally been fixed. I wish that when I want to record a show that has already started, that it would record from the start of the show. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. It's upsetting with some shows that if you miss the first few minutes, you lose the gist of the entire show. I wish there was more grouping of like shows, ie: putting all &quot;shopping&quot; shows together. Perhaps make it a 'cafeteria' style plan where one doesn't have to pay for shows they never watch. Overall, I am pleased with my Prism.</p>
