				<p>I rated picture quality only average, because on my tv, a Sharp Aquos, I am getting blurring when there is fast motion. I was told that I can not use a HDMI cable with your fiber optic system and with this tv,so the technician installed a high resolution ultra shield cable instead. It does not get rid of the blurring. Why does this happen? Why only on Sharp Aquos sets?<br />
<br />
There is no picture in picture, with your DVR and remote, like on many other systems. I really miss it. I would also like to have a DVR that allows me to record more shows in HD, at the same time. I can only watch one show and record one other show, in HD, at the same time.</p>
