				<p>The remote controllers are too complicated for us. Half the time the tv gets turned off, but not the box, or vice versa. It has way too much on it for what we need and want. The layout is not good either, at least not for how we use our tv. Because of this, we are going to switch to another provider who had one main controller and the rest were just simple ones.<br />
<br />
We don't like the channel lineup and resent having to pay to add a channel to the line up.<br />
<br />
My internet is slower than it was before, although we were told it would be faster. We do like the wifi included in your equipment.</p>
