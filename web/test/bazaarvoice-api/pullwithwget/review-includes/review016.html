				<p>From the get-go we have had trouble with the box and TV synchronizing. Turn one on and the other stays off; or one off and the other stays on. Then figuring out what button to push on the remote to make the other correspond remains frustrating and upsetting. My husband swears he'd never get this product again. (We do love the DVR.) Since we bundle, I love the speed of the internet and our phone service is excellent. But watching TV and constantly being frustrated with the box and TV not synchronizing, is a big problem in our family.<br />
<br />
I also wish in your TV line up you would get God TV.</p>
