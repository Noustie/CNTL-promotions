				<p>I do not care for prism, but since I have it I am using it. The channel freeze up. Sometimes the channels come in in the daytime and may not come in at night. I think that channel like animal planet, national geographic, diy and few other general channels should be on the small package that's offered. They are on other cable services. I have had it to go out during storms. I don't know how much longer I will be a prism customer</p>
