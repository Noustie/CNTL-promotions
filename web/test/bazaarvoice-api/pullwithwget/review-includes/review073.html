				<p>I love the Prism but the total package is more each month than I was originally quoted when I purchased it. Was told I would save money but that is not the case, it is costing me more each month and the bill changes every month. Why doesn't the payment stay the same? I realize if I purchase a movie that would change but other than that, the payment should be the same each month. Was hoping my payment would be lower so I am disappointed in that respect.</p>
