				<p>We have had repeated periods of short freezes in the picture and some digitalization. The service seems pricey for what you get. We can only get two sets on HD at the same time, not enough when we have six sets hooked up and paying for all boxes. We bundle for two houses (internet is a bit slow and email display is clumsy) and are thinking about returning to Comcast. Have had your service for almost three years in one house and somewhat shorter in the other. Seems like you oversold service before your plant capacity was fully in place.</p>
