				<p>CenturyLink Prism has been a problem, almost on a weekly basis since it was installed over a year ago. For the price of the service, one would expect a problem free tv viewing. The sound and picture freeze up for no apparent reason at least once a week, usually at the most inopertune times. We have to reboot the modum at least twice a week, and reset the DVR (unplug and restart) several times a week.<br />
<br />
I have to say the customer service tech staff and the visiting linesmen are most gratious and helpful, but they are working with a system that is less than optimal or user friendly.</p>
