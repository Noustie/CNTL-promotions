				<p>We have had CenturyLink internet service for many years with no issues at all so I thought Prism TV would be just as good. I was totally wrong. We have had Prism TV since October 2012 and I have had to call technical support at least twice a month. I have to reset the boxes at least one a week because the picture freezes or becomes choppy. The only good thing about Prism TV is the channel lineup and DVR. I am just not happy with this service at all and cannot wait for my contract to be over.</p>
