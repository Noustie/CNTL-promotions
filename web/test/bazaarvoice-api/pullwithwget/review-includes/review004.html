				<p>Great system, but still getting digital dropout on some channels. I thought this was just growing pains for Prism, but it is not getting any better. I know one Prism customer that wants to cancel because Prism cannot fix their picture freezing and dropouts. My main DVR box re-boots now and then and/or completely freezes up and I have to re-boot it. Sometimes the DVR stops recording for no apparent reason.<br />
<br />
The limit of two HD recordings at a time is absurd! If I want to record three or more shows, I must record them in non-HD mode! What a waste of a HD TV set! There should be no limit to recording shows or watching on TV on a set-top box. I have five boxes (TVs) and can only use four at a time unless two of them are watching the same program.</p>
