				<p>I've had a great experience across the board with CenturyLink so far. Download and upload speeds have been tremendous and reliable. Initially my phone line was cut (which was interesting) and the CenturyLink support and tech were great to deal with and the problem was taken care of easily. All other contact with CenturyLink representatives has been positive. I think information on the website and bill is presented clearly, so anything I've needed I've found pretty easily on my own. Excellent overall.</p>
