				<p>I have had problems with my connection speed and connection multiple times. The only thing Century Link has right is good customer service. Seriously, the customer service is better than their internet service. They don't randomly drop to no signal' or some ridiculously low speed. Now, I have tried almost everything. I have read up online, I have called and even had the wiring checked... This curse has followed me from one apartment to another and it now is just getting old.</p>
