				<p>It is not the 1 gig per second that it was advertised to be, nor is the speed 40 Mbps, more like 36. I now understand that I would have to pay more for 1 gig. So, it is about 12 times faster than the 3 Mbps I had before, but actually doesn't seem that much faster. That has been explained to be caused by other devices in use at the time. However, it is reliable, and the customer service people are very good, even though I get varying answers at times, from one person to another.</p>
