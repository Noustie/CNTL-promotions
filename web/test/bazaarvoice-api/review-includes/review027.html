				<p>We switched service because the speed indicated was supposed to be as good as our other service provided by the local cable company. The speed hasn't been what was advertised. I have tested it with other speed check software and it is slow compared to the centurylink connection software.<br />
Have also had to reset the router numerous times due to connection issues. After reseting the router connection was restored. Have had to reset much to frequently.<br />
Dont' know if I would have switched if I had to do it all over again.</p>
