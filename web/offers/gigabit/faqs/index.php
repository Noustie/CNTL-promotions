				<p class="first">When you have Internet speeds up to 1 Gbps, it can change the way you work and play. Stream HD movies from multiple devices at once, upload videos, numerous images or huge presentations in seconds, video chat with no interruptions and get the most out of every Internet-connected device you own. Now you can back up all your photos, documents and files in seconds. With this connection, you can access it all in an instant without losing time to buffering. CenturyLink 1 gigabit fiber service gives you that same ultra-fast speed in both uploads <i>and</i> downloads.</p>

We&rsquo;ve also received great support from community and government leaders in Las Vegas who see the growth opportunities that broadband speeds up to 1 Gbps bring. The launch of this service will place Las Vegas in a very select group of cities with access to this next-generation Internet technology.</p>
