	<p>Nothing beats a <a href="/home/phone/">traditional landline</a> for long phone calls and the sense of security that comes from knowing your phone will work, even during power outages. But some folks have decided a landline isn't necessary for them. We just want to ensure that you know all the benefits of a landline, so you can make an informed decision on what's right for you.</p>
	 
	<p class="tab-heading">Be on the safe side. </p>
	<p>A landline is a secure line.  </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Landlines are more dependable, when it matters most. 911 calls made from landline phones are immediately traced to your specific address, which can save time in a crisis. This isn't always the case with 911 calls made on mobile devices. </li>
		<li>Power outages rarely affect a landline, and users don't have to worry as much about not getting a strong signal.  (P.S. Be sure to keep a telephone that doesn't require electricity, or one with a battery backup.)  </li>
		<li>Many security systems require a landline, because landline monitoring is by far the most reliable method of sending your alarm's signal.</li>
		<li>While cell phone calls can be intercepted, doing so on a landline requires access to the cable itself. So landlines are more secure for discussing private or sensitive information like financial accounts and medical records.</li>
		<li>Phone rings throughout the house, so there isn't a chance of missing an important call.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="tab-heading">Sometimes you need a wire to stay connected </p>
	<p>Mobile phones offer many advantages, but many customers like you enjoy also having the stability of a landline. A landline offers:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A more stable connection</li>
		<li>Crystal-clear sound  </li>
		<li>No delays or dropped calls</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There's a reason why long phone conversations with friends and family members are simply more enjoyable on a real home phone line.</p>
