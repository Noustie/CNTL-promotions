	<p class="tab-heading">Can you install CenturyLink&reg; High-Speed Internet service yourself?</p>
	<p>The short answer is yes. But, you'd be better off letting a CenturyLink Tech handle the installation to make sure your Internet performs up to its full potential. The long answer is, even if you feel comfortable handling the installation, a CenturyLink Tech Install may still be necessary in certain circumstances: </p>
	<ul> 
		<li>If your previous provider was a cable company, as we'll need to reconnect the CenturyLink phone box to your inside wiring. </li>
		<li>If your home was built before 1980, since an older home's wiring doesn't support maximum High-Speed Internet speeds.</li>
		<li>If you live in an apartment building.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="tab-heading">Let a CenturyLink Technician install your Internet service &ndash; it's important for maximum performance.</p>
	<p>You know your way around modems and routers, and you've probably installed your own Internet service before. But it's still a good idea to let us handle the installation. That way you can be sure you're getting the highest performance possible without unforeseen factors &ndash; like the condition of your home's inside wiring and jacks &ndash; deteriorating your service.</p>
