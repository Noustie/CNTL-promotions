	<p class="tab-heading">For starters, you'll always have a price you can count on.</p>
	As a CenturyLink customer, you have access to something no other provider offers – the CenturyLink Price-Lock Guarantee. That means the monthly price you sign up for will be the same – no surprises. And there's no term commitment, meaning the price is locked in, but you're not. What's more, this price stays with you, even when you move.</p>
	 
	<p class="tab-heading">Easy access to customer service</p>
	<p>CenturyLink offers a number of ways for our customers to get information and help when they need it – Facebook, Online Support and 24/7 chat, Twitter – and of course, if you ever want to talk to someone, we have a dedicated support team available to assist you with any need.</p>

	<p class="tab-heading">Bundle for savings and simplicity.</p>
	<p>You can make your life and bills less complicated by bundling all your services together on one bill. There are lots of ways to bundle…even if you don't want a landline:  </p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="/home/mobile/">Verizon Wireless service</a> and <a href="/home/internet/">High-Speed Internet</a></li>
		<li><a herf="/home/tv/">DirecTV&reg;</a>/<a href="http://www.seeprismtv.com">Prism&trade;</a> and <a href="/home/internet/">High-Speed Internet</a></li>
		<li>DirecTV&reg;/Prism&trade;, Verizon Wireless service and High-Speed Internet</li>
		<li>You can also include a <a href="/home/phone">home phone</a> in a bundle. Maybe you don't need it now, but some day you may.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>So you can get all your communications and entertainment on one bill – for less. For example, customers who bundles TV, Internet and Phone with CenturyLink will have a lower bill every month than if they ordered the same services individually. And, in certain markets, you can save even more by adding Verizon Wireless service through CenturyLink to your bundle.</p>

	<p class="tab-heading">Welcome to a new level of TV.</p>
	<p>CenturyLink takes TV service up a notch. Not only do you get your favorite programming and On Demand content, you get it in crystal-clear HD – and with advanced features that put you in complete control. For example, with Whole Home DVR you can record, watch, pause and play in up to 4 rooms of your house with a single DVR unit.</p>
