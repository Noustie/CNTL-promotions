				<p>The things I DON'T like about Prism TV: (a) Only one HD connection so when I want to watch something and record other things I have to record it in non HD and the picture is totally distorted making everyone look fat and heavy; (b) Channel lineup is poor in most cases with poor programming; (c) The guide leaves a lot to be desired. When you pull it up the picture is still behind it and it is very hard to read; (d) Limited ways to use the guide. Mandy of the channels cannot be found in the local paper directory of what is on. If I want to look for sports items or movies etc. I have to go through everything on the guide to try to find what sports are on. Why can't we just have an option to choose something like &quot;sport&quot; and only search those channels that have sports on like the other providers offer: (e) the boxes in the house do not sync and therefore if 2 people are watching the same channel in say the living room and the kitchen, one is HD and the other isn't and the sound is not in sync so you hear an echo because they are saying the same thing but one is delayed; (f) If you change stations, the volume is different on each station and you have to adjust it; (g) If you want to try to record something, you have to goo to it in the guide and then go to information to find out if it new and not a rerun. Couldn't all the new shows that have not shown that episode be marked with an (n) in the guide rather than being so cumbersome then if it is a show you like, you can just record it rather than going through the other steps. I don't know if I will stay with Prism in the fall.</p>
