<strong>Offer ends 9/30/2013. Offer available online, in select areas and to new Prism&trade; TV customers only.  Existing customers will lose current discounts by subscribing to this offer. Listed rate of $79.95/mo. will apply to Pure Broadband service (up to 20 Mbps) and basic Prism TV programming package for six consecutive months (after six months the monthly rate for Prism, and after 12 months the monthly rate for Pure, will revert to the then-current standard monthly rates). Both Prism&trade; TV and Pure Broadband require a 12-month term agreement.  A $9.99 monthly DVR service fee applies when the Whole Home DVR is purchased with Prism&trade; TV (after applicable promotional offer). Customer must cancel Whole Home DVR and HD service by calling CenturyLink Customer Service before the end of the 3-month-free promotional period to avoid monthly charges or the standard monthly rate for each service will apply until services are cancelled. An additional monthly or flat fee, installation fee, and separate shipping and handling fee may apply to customer&rsquo;s modem or router, depending on HSI package and options selected. All prices, packages and programming are subject to change without notice. Taxes, fees and surcharges will apply. Offer cannot be combined with other promotions. General &ndash;</strong> Services and offers not available everywhere. CenturyLink may change or cancel services or substitute similar services at its sole discretion without notice. Offer, plans, and stated rates are subject to change and may vary by service area. Requires credit approval and deposit may be required. Additional restrictions apply. <strong>Terms and Conditions &ndash;</strong> All products and services listed are governed by tariffs, terms of service, or terms and conditions posted at www.centurylink.com. <strong>Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges &ndash;</strong> Applicable taxes, fees, and surcharges include a Carrier Universal Service charge, National Access Fee surcharge, a one-time Pure activation fee, state and local fees that vary by area and certain in-state surcharges. Cost recovery fees are not taxes or government-required charges for use. Taxes, fees, and surcharges apply based on standard monthly, not promotional, rates. Call for a listing of applicable taxes, fees, and surcharges. <strong>Monthly Rate &ndash;</strong> Monthly rate applies while customer subscribes to all qualifying services. If one (1) or more services are cancelled, the standard monthly fee will apply to each remaining service. <strong>Pure Broadband &ndash;</strong> As determined by service location, an early termination fee will apply as either a flat $99 fee or the applicable monthly recurring service fee multiplied by the number of months remaining in the minimum service period, up to $200. Customers must accept High-Speed Internet Subscriber Agreement prior to using service. Listed broadband speeds vary due to conditions outside of network control, including customer location and equipment, and are not guaranteed. In some areas, a telephone landline may be required as a part of the service but only for the purpose of data traffic transmission/connection and cannot be used for voice traffic transmission, except 911 services. <strong>CenturyLink&reg; Prism&trade; TV &ndash;</strong> Subscription to Prism service in certain Prism territories may require a separate local phone service and preclude customers from purchasing high-speed Internet services from any third party. Service includes digital channels (including local channels), one (1) or two (2) set-top box(es) (STB), depending upon plan selected, one (1) modem gateway, and up to four (4) standard direct video streams to residence. CenturyLink-provided set-top boxes are required to view TV. If a term commitment is required for listed Prism offer and customer terminates those services before the end of the applicable term commitment, CenturyLink will assess an early termination fee of up to $20, multiplied by the number of months remaining in customer&rsquo;s then-current term commitment. Local channel availability varies by market. Caller ID service must be purchased separately to enable the on-screen Caller ID feature; Caller ID feature is not available in all areas. High Definition (HD) available on all TV plans for an additional $11.99/month. Of the 4 video streams per customer residence, customer&rsquo;s location will determine both HD availability and the maximum number of HD video streams (between 0 and 4) a customer can view and record in HD at any one time (remaining streams will be standard definition) regardless of the number of set-top boxes in the household. Additional charges will apply for additional programming packages, movie channel subscriptions (except for Prism&trade; Premium plan), Pay Per View movies and events, On Demand purchases, and premium services/subscriptions for all plans. Some subscription services, events, and broadcast network service may be blacked out in customer&rsquo;s area. In order for media sharing to operate correctly, customer must have Windows 7 or Vista and Windows Media Player 11.
