            <h3>CenturyLink plans expansion of Las Vegas gigabit fiber network</h3>
            <p class="news-blurb">
                Company will double the number of homes eligible for 1 gigabit service
            </p>

    		<p>
                <strong>LAS VEGAS</strong> –- CenturyLink, Inc. (NYSE: CTL), which offers the fastest residential broadband speeds in Las Vegas, has announced plans to expand its gigabit fiber network and more than double the number of homes eligible for up to 1 gigabit per second (Gbps) service by the end of 2014.
    		</p>
            <p>
                CenturyLink first launched its up to 1 Gbps fiber service in Las Vegas in October 2013, delivering ultra-fast broadband speeds up to 100 times faster than the national average download speeds to residential customers in the northwest Las Vegas area. This fiber network expansion will bring the service to select residential communities in the west, southwest, Rhodes Ranch, Southern Highlands, North Las Vegas, Henderson and Anthem areas of Las Vegas.
            </p>
            <p>
                &ldquo;Due to the demand for our 1 gigabit fiber service, we are accelerating our projected expansion timeline in order to provide more customers with access to our ultra-fast broadband service,&rdquo; said Jeff Oberschelp, CenturyLink vice president and general manager for Las Vegas. &ldquo;Customers using our 1 gigabit service have seen the way this next-generation technology can power their everyday activity. This year we expect to double the number of homes that can connect to this service and will continue  working to fulfill the response we&rsquo;ve received for this unrivaled product offering.&rdquo;
            </p>
            <p>
                From uninterrupted movie streaming and video calls to instant downloads and uploads of massive multimedia files, this CenturyLink 1 Gbps fiber service enables customers to enhance the efficiency and enjoyment of both their work and personal lives from home. 
            </p>
            <p>
                &ldquo;I applaud CenturyLink&rsquo;s efforts to rapidly expand their 1 gigabit Internet service throughout Southern Nevada,&rdquo; said Henderson Mayor Andy Hafen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been intrigued by this technology since CenturyLink first announced they were launching it in our area. I can&rsquo;t wait to see the positive effect these Internet speeds will have for Henderson residents in the Anthem area.&rdquo;
            </p>
            <p>
                The expansion of its residential up to 1 Gbps fiber service is part of CenturyLink&rsquo;s efforts to enhance its local network and increase broadband speeds in Las Vegas throughout 2014 and beyond. 
            </p>
            <p>
                &ldquo;The expansion of CenturyLink&rsquo;s super-high speed, gigabit Internet service into the Southern Highlands and Anthem areas is a big boost for our community,&rdquo; said County Commission Chair Steve Sisolak, who represents the area. &ldquo;I know many residents are eager to access this technology and I&rsquo;m interested to see the results as CenturyLink expands this network here.&rdquo;
            </p>
            <p>
