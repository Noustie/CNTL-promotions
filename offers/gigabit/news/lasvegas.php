            <h3>CenturyLink brings 1 gigabit fiber service to Las Vegas</h3>
            <p class="news-blurb">
                New broadband technology will deliver some of the fastest Internet speeds in the U.S.
            </p>
    		<span class="date">10/09/13</span>
    		<p>
    			<strong>MONROE, La.,</strong> October 9, 2013 -– CenturyLink, Inc. (NYSE: CTL) today announced that it will expand its fiber network pilot to Las Vegas, enabling Internet speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second (Gbps). CenturyLink’s enhanced fiber network will deliver this ultra-fast broadband technology to residential and small business customers in select Las Vegas neighborhoods beginning this fall.
    		</p>
            <p>
                CenturyLink launched its first 1 Gbps fiber network in <a href="http://news.centurylink.com/index.php?s=43&item=3044" target="_blank">Omaha, Neb.</a> in May 2013. The company expects to have the targeted homes and business in Omaha connected with its fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) technology by the end of October. The company will also use FTTP technology to deliver some of the fastest Internet speeds available in the United States to select homes and small businesses in Las Vegas. With this highly-advanced service, customers will be able to download a high-definition movie in seconds and stream it from multiple devices, gain instant access to cloud services and applications on demand, and download or upload large multimedia files – all at the same time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “CenturyLink is pleased to announce that Las Vegas will be the next city to receive ultra-fast broadband speeds up to 1 Gbps,” said Matt Beal, CenturyLink chief technology officer. “We know our customers will embrace this new technology that will allow them to simultaneously use multiple devices in their homes and businesses without the burden of bandwidth constraints.”
            </p>
            <p>
                CenturyLink’s 1 Gbps service is equivalent to 1,000 Mbps – an Internet speed that is 100 times faster than average broadband speeds – and will have a direct connection to the company’s recently upgraded 100 Gbps global network, designed to accommodate today’s bandwidth demands. This next generation fiber technology also enables CenturyLink to provide a symmetrical service, meaning customers can download and upload information at identical speeds of up to 1 Gbps.
            </p>
            <p>
                “This is wonderful news for Las Vegas,” said U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. “Advances like these will ensure that Las Vegas continues to cement its reputation as a high-tech hub. I support these efforts by CenturyLink, and welcome more investments in our local economy. I look forward to even more access to high-speed technology in Las Vegas and throughout Nevada.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “An aspect of my efforts as Governor has been fostering the growth of Nevada’s technology industry throughout the state,” said Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval. “Las Vegas has always been one of America’s most connected cities and is quickly becoming a premier destination for launching tech-focused businesses. CenturyLink’s high-speed 1 Gbps fiber network pilot in Las Vegas adds another level of vital infrastructure to support our continued growth as a technology-driven city.”
            </p>
            <p>
                 “1 Gbps symmetrical speed provides a tremendous economic advantage for small businesses because it allows them to purchase their IT infrastructure through the cloud while substantially lowering operating costs,” said Jeff Oberschelp, CenturyLink vice president and general manager – Las Vegas. “This capability is key to growing a vibrant startup and tech community in Las Vegas.” 
            </p>
            <p>
                CenturyLink will make its 1 Gbps service available to residents in its first Las Vegas community this fall and intends to launch the service in additional communities into 2014. Small business customers in select locations will also be eligible for 1 Gbps service in early 2014.
